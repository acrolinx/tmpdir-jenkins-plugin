        Creates a private temporary directory before each build and deletes it afterwards in order to keep the
        system-wide temporary directory tidy.
    </p>
    <p>
        The environment variables <code>TMP</code>, <code>TEMP</code> and <code>TMPDIR</code> are also exported so
        that all sane utilities should automatically use this temporary directory.
    </p>
    <p>
        Java is not one of those sane applications (at least on UNIX/Linux), so the Java system property
        <code>java.io.tmpdir</code> is set using the environment variable <code>JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS</code>. Should
        this variable already be set, then this property is appended to the existing value of that variable.
